Due to the the rapidly advancing capabilities in Artificial Intelligence (AI), I believe that aligning AI with human values is [a key global priority](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uK7NhdSKprQKZnRjU58X7NLA1auXlWHt/view). I am aiming to use [my career](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/) to reduce the risks associated with the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). 

I wrote my [undergraduate thesis](https://thlarsen.netlify.app/publication/senior_thesis/) on maintaining high quality uncertainty estimations, under distribution shift. I was grateful to be advised by [Xun Huan](https://me.engin.umich.edu/people/faculty/xun-ryan-huan/) and [Tom Wenisch](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~twenisch/). 

I am excited about [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), and am one of the organizers of the [University of Michigan Effective Altrusim club](https://www.eaumich.org/).
