Hi, I'm Thomas! I am a fourth year Math and CS student at the University of Michigan graduating in May 2022. I am seeking a technical ML job for which I can apply my skills to create a positive impact.   

My research interests are very broad -- I am interested in the big picture questions having to do with how to make safe AI systems that can make a positive social impact. I am working on an undergraduate thesis, and am grateful to be advised by [Tom Wenisch](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~twenisch/). I am developing algorithms to robustly represent uncertainty within neural networks, in particular, maintaining high quality uncertainty estimations, under distribution shift. 

I am excited about [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), and am one of the organizers of the University of Michigan Effective Altrusim club. 

In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, telemark skiing, and reading.
