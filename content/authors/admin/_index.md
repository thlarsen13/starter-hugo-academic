I am an undergraduate at the University of Michigan graduating in May 2022. I am working on a senior thesis. Research and stuff 
 <!-- I am co-advised by [Tom Wenisch](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~twenisch/) and [Ron Dreslinski](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~rdreslin/). My research is primarily on software systems for visual analytics: developing frameworks and techniques at scale to leverage existing computer vision models and kernels. I am currently working on a project funded by the [ADA (Applications Driving Architectures) Center](http://www.adacenter.org), previously having worked on projects funded by [Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/) and [ARM](http://www.arm.com). I interned at ARM three times, once with the CPU Engineering group (helping design what became the [Cortex-A76](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-A76)) and twice with the High Performance Computing Research group. -->
I like teaching and blah blah blah 
<!-- I am a strong proponent of computer science education for all, having taught at the high school through graduate level. I recently served as a primary instructor for the undergraduate computer architecture course at Michigan ([EECS 370](https://eecs370.github.io/)), and my paper on teaching out-of-order RISC-V core design as a capstone undergraduate course ([EECS 470](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs470/)) was published at SIGCSE '21. -->
